            <h3>Yoda's Death</h3>
            <p>
                Despite his eventful life full of battles and teaching, Yoda did not die with a bang, but a whisper. He lay peacefully in his hut on as he emparted some words of wisdom to Luke Skywalker. Yoda gradually disappeard and became one with the force. He would later appear in visions to other characters in the Star Wars universe continuing to speak wisdom past his death.
