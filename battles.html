            <h3>A Coulple of Yoda's Battles</h3>
            <h3>Battle of Coruscant</h3>
            <p>
                Yoda fought alongside Captain Fordo and Mace Windu to protect Chancellor Palpatine. However, they were ultimately unsuccessful, as he was captured by General Grievous. 
                This is where Yoda set his attention to tracking down the Sith Lord and tensions increased to a new height between the Jedi and the Sith.

            <h3>Duel in the Senate</h3>
            <p>
                This was an important fight between Yoda and Darth Sidious that showcased both fighter's impressive connection with the force. The combination of Yoda's and Sidious's use of the force created an orb between the two that ultimately blasted them apart.
                An exhausted Yoda was forced to escape after his inability to defeat the Sith lord.
