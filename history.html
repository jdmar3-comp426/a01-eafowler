            <h3>A Brief Backstory</h3>
            <p>
                While Yoda's species and precise history remains largely unknown, he was highley revered for his lightsaber combat skills and connection to the force. He was a high-ranking member of the Jedi Council for many years and eventually became the master of the order.
                In addition to his own skills, Yoda placed a stong emphasis on instruction of younger up and coming Jedi including the likes of Luke Skywalker. His training helped Luke to start the New Jedi Order before his death.
